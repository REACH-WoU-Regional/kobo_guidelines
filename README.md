# How to Kobo


## variable and choice naming

Pertains to the column `name` in _'survey'_ and _'choices'_ tabs

- as a general rule, please pick names that are human-readable and give a hint as to what this variable is representing

    e.g. `"hh_num_girls_under_18"` and not: `"abahh_u18f"`

- the name needs to contain at least one letter

    e.g. ` "25_50_percent" `, not: `"25_50" `

- do not use any whitespaces, use underscores instead
- do not include any other special characters (diacritics, apostrophes, hyphens, dashes, other symbols) - it's best to stick to lowercase letters, numbers and underscores!

    e.g. ` "kraj_kosice" `, not: `"Košický kraj"`
